#' Pointwise Selection Thresholds for Complementary Pairs Stability Selection (CPSS)
#' 
#' @description
#' This function calculates pointwise selection thresholds for CPSS from
#' \insertCite{shah_variable_2013}{fastfrechet}. Empirical CPSS selection proportions
#' above these thresholds have pointwise control on the number of selected variables
#' which have "low selection probability" \eqn{\theta}. This function uses the default
#' \eqn{\theta = q/p}, where `q` is the estimated model size after variable selection.
#' 
#' @param p A positive integer giving the total number of variables.
#' @param q A numeric vector giving average model size(s) after variable selection, each entry strictly within `(0, p)`.
#' @param B A positive integer giving the number of complementary pairs splits (default `50`).
#' @param E_thr A positive numeric scalar giving the desired constraint on the number of final selected variables with "low selection probability" (default `1`).
#'
#' @details
#' CPSS obtains a final selected model by identifying variables selected a high
#' proportion of times during repeated data splits. It is a meta-procedure that
#' works independent of the baseline variable selection procedure, such as LASSO
#' or, in the case of variable selection for Fr√©chet regression, FRiSO. Under
#' certain conditions, \insertCite{shah_variable_2013}{fastfrechet} derived
#' thresholds for this empirical selection proportion that control the expected
#' number of variables which have "low selection probability", i.e. are disfavored
#' by the baseline procedure like FRiSO. This function inverts the problem by
#' identifying the minimum threshold necessary to control the selection procedure.
#' 
#' \insertCite{shah_variable_2013}{fastfrechet} recommend defining "low selection
#' probability" as relative to model size. A variable has low selection probability
#' if it is selected less frequently than the average relative model size, that
#' is, the number of selected variables `q` divided by the number of total
#' variables `p`. This function takes `p` and `q` as inputs (`q` may be a vector),
#' as well as the number of CPSS data splits `B` and desired control level `E_thr`.
#' Note that error control is pointwise per `q`.

#' @return A list object with components:
#' \tabular{ll}{
#'   `E_thr` \tab returns the selection constraint, as provided to the function. \cr
#'   `B` \tab returns the number of complementary pairs splits, as provided to the function. \cr
#'   `relative_model_size` \tab returns the relative model size, i.e. `q / p` from the function inputs. \cr
#'   `pointwise_thresholds` \tab returns a `p`-long vector of calculated selection thresholds. See details. \cr
