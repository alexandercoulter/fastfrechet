	abstract = {With the growing prevalence of diabetes and the associated public health burden, it is crucial to identify modifiable factors that could improve patients' glycemic control. In this work, we seek to examine associations between medication usage, concurrent comorbidities, and glycemic control, utilizing data from continuous glucose monitor (CGMs). CGMs provide interstitial glucose measurements, but reducing data to simple statistical summaries is common in clinical studies, resulting in substantial information loss. Recent advancements in the Frechet regression framework allow to utilize more information by treating the full distributional representation of CGM data as the response, while sparsity regularization enables variable selection. However, the methodology does not scale to large datasets. Crucially, variable selection inference using subsampling methods is computationally infeasible. We develop a new algorithm for sparse distributional regression by deriving a new explicit characterization of the gradient and Hessian of the underlying objective function, while also utilizing rotations on the sphere to perform feasible updates. The updated method is up to 10000-fold faster than the original approach, opening the door for applying sparse distributional regression to large-scale datasets and enabling previously unattainable subsampling-based inference. Applying our method to CGM data from patients with type 2 diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea, we found a significant association between sulfonylurea medication and glucose variability without evidence of association with glucose mean. We also found that overnight oxygen desaturation variability showed a stronger association with glucose regulation than overall oxygen desaturation levels.},

            Estimation of structure, such as in variable selection, graphical modelling or cluster analysis, is notoriously difficult, especially for high dimensional data. We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

	abstract = {Summary
            Stability selection was recently introduced by Meinshausen and Bühlmann as a very general technique designed to improve the performance of a variable selection algorithm. It is based on aggregating the results of applying a selection procedure to subsamples of the data. We introduce a variant, called complementary pairs stability selection, and derive bounds both on the expected number of variables included by complementary pairs stability selection that have low selection probability under the original procedure, and on the expected number of high selection probability variables that are excluded. These results require no (e.g. exchangeability) assumptions on the underlying model or on the quality of the original selection procedure. Under reasonable shape restrictions, the bounds can be further tightened, yielding improved error control, and therefore increasing the applicability of the methodology.},
