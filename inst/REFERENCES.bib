	abstract = {With the growing prevalence of diabetes and the associated public health burden, it is crucial to identify modifiable factors that could improve patients' glycemic control. In this work, we seek to examine associations between medication usage, concurrent comorbidities, and glycemic control, utilizing data from continuous glucose monitor (CGMs). CGMs provide interstitial glucose measurements, but reducing data to simple statistical summaries is common in clinical studies, resulting in substantial information loss. Recent advancements in the Frechet regression framework allow to utilize more information by treating the full distributional representation of CGM data as the response, while sparsity regularization enables variable selection. However, the methodology does not scale to large datasets. Crucially, variable selection inference using subsampling methods is computationally infeasible. We develop a new algorithm for sparse distributional regression by deriving a new explicit characterization of the gradient and Hessian of the underlying objective function, while also utilizing rotations on the sphere to perform feasible updates. The updated method is up to 10000-fold faster than the original approach, opening the door for applying sparse distributional regression to large-scale datasets and enabling previously unattainable subsampling-based inference. Applying our method to CGM data from patients with type 2 diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea, we found a significant association between sulfonylurea medication and glucose variability without evidence of association with glucose mean. We also found that overnight oxygen desaturation variability showed a stronger association with glucose regulation than overall oxygen desaturation levels.},

	abstract = {Summary Estimation of structure, such as in variable selection, graphical modelling or cluster analysis, is notoriously difficult, especially for high dimensional data. We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

	abstract = {Summary Stability selection was recently introduced by Meinshausen and Bühlmann as a very general technique designed to improve the performance of a variable selection algorithm. It is based on aggregating the results of applying a selection procedure to subsamples of the data. We introduce a variant, called complementary pairs stability selection, and derive bounds both on the expected number of variables included by complementary pairs stability selection that have low selection probability under the original procedure, and on the expected number of high selection probability variables that are excluded. These results require no (e.g. exchangeability) assumptions on the underlying model or on the quality of the original selection procedure. Under reasonable shape restrictions, the bounds can be further tightened, yielding improved error control, and therefore increasing the applicability of the methodology.},

	abstract = {Biosensor data have the potential to improve disease control and detection. However, the analysis of these data under free-living conditions is not feasible with current statistical techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce a new functional representation of biosensor data, termed the glucodensity, together with a data analysis framework based on distances between them. The new data analysis procedure is illustrated through an application in diabetes with continuous-time glucose monitoring (CGM) data. In this domain, we show marked improvement with respect to state-of-the-art analysis methods. In particular, our findings demonstrate that (i) the glucodensity possesses an extraordinary clinical sensitivity to capture the typical biomarkers used in the standard clinical practice in diabetes; (ii) previous biomarkers cannot accurately predict glucodensity, so that the latter is a richer source of information and; (iii) the glucodensity is a natural generalization of the time in range metric, this being the gold standard in the handling of CGM data. Furthermore, the new method overcomes many of the drawbacks of time in range metrics and provides more in-depth insight into assessing glucose metabolism.},

	abstract = {Summary With the advent of continuous health monitoring with wearable devices, users now generate their unique streams of continuous data such as minute-level step counts or heartbeats. Summarizing these streams via scalar summaries often ignores the distributional nature of wearable data and almost unavoidably leads to the loss of critical information. We propose to capture the distributional nature of wearable data via user-specific quantile functions (QF) and use these QFs as predictors in scalar-on-quantile-function-regression (SOQFR). As an alternative approach, we also propose to represent QFs via user-specific L-moments, robust rank-based analogs of traditional moments, and use L-moments as predictors in SOQFR (SOQFR-L). These two approaches provide two mutually consistent interpretations: in terms of quantile levels by SOQFR and in terms of L-moments by SOQFR-L. We also demonstrate how to deal with multi-modal distributional data via Joint and Individual Variation Explained using L-moments. The proposed methods are illustrated in a study of association of digital gait biomarkers with cognitive function in Alzheimers disease. Our analysis shows that the proposed methods demonstrate higher predictive performance and attain much stronger associations with clinical cognitive scales compared to simple distributional summaries.},
