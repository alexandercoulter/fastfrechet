\title{Complementary Pairs Stability Selection (CPSS) for FRiSO, for Univariate Distribution Responses Equipped with the 2-Wasserstein Metric}
\usage{
FRiSO_CPSS_univar2wass(X, Y, B = 50, thresh = 1e-04, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{}

\item{Y}{}

\item{B}{Positive integer number of complementary pair sub-samples to take of original data set (default 50).}

\item{thresh}{A finite positive scalar selection threshold, where \eqn{\hat{lambda}_k(\tau) > }\code{thresh} means the \eqn{k^{th}} variable is selected, and not selected otherwise.}

\item{...}{other inputs to FRiSO see \code{\link[=FRiSO_univar2wass]{FRiSO_univar2wass()}}.}
}
\value{
List containing: 'tau', a vector containing the values of tau which were fed into the function call; 'selected_variables' element, a \link{B by 2 by length(tauseq) by p} array containing 0's and 1's identifying which variables were selected by CPSS per sub-sample; 'selected_samples' element, a \link{B x 2 x length(tauseq) x n} array containing 0's and 1's identifying which samples were selected in course of CPSS; a 'stability_paths' element, a \link{length(tauseq) x p} matrix containing stability measures for each variable (column-wise) against given tauseq.
