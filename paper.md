# Summary

This is the paper's summary.

# Statement of need

This is the paper's statement of need

# Mathematics

This is an equation example $x = 1$.

This is another equation example
$$
\begin{align}
x &= 1 \\
x + 2 &= 3
\end{align}
$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.
